# PHP-DB-Example
Example of PHP, MySQL, Vue.js, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 3.
This was a project where I managed MySQL database using PHP as a server side back end, and Vue.js as a client side back end.
I used Axios.js to access PHP database API that I created.
Vue scripts are responsible for dynamic adjustment of displayed data and pagination.
These: pet_datasql, owner_pet.sql, owner_data.sql are just simple dummy data for DB.
Database is created by db.sql, and accessed using an API that I developed using PHP.
